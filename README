The current version is SWT 4.4.2

This version of SWT is patched to be used as a static library without any external dependencies.

The list of current modifications (based on "vanilla" src.zip contents):

All platforms:
1. All makefiles modified to build static libraries (to link them together with other projects)
2. All org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library implementations are modified to avoid any external jni library loading
3. JNI_OnLoad function is commented out in order to avoid possible symbol duplication
4. All external dependencies that require anything except the default system APIs are commented out (Mozilla XULRunner, etc.). They could be added back, but I don't use them, so they are not targeted by default.

Windows:
5. Windows version is being built with mingw-w64 toolchain on Windows (SEH exceptions turned off, an MSYS makefile created) to avoid hard and unintuitive configuration of Windows SDK (and linkage problems between microsoft cl compiler and gcc)
6. There are some excluded features (not much) that are added to defines.h due to some incompleteness of mingw-w64 WINAPI implementation. Nothing serious, though.

The main problem (and possible issue) under Windows is SEH that's turned off. I didn't manage to fix it yet. If you have any ideas about how to do it, you are welcome to create an issue ticket.
